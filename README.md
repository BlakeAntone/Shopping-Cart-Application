# Shopping-Cart-Application
This is a simple shopping cart dektop application that connects to and stores its list of invetory products and the 
current cart contents using a WebAPI. There are 2 possible sub types of Products that differ primarily based on their 
pricing model, products by weight an products by item. These are stored under the Library.Product Class library within
the Desktop client application folder. Prodcuts are added to the cart by simply clicking the product in the inventory, and
removed by clicking a product in the cart view. All data is stored via the web service so the cart will maintaint tis contetnts
if the client-side application is closed and re-opened.
